This is a quick hack to support keyboard navigation for remarkable 2 for page flips. I might add more functionality like file or folder navigation later. This is just to show a proof of concept.

To use it, you need to have python installed on Remarkable 2, then just run "Python main.py". When it's running you can use left or right arrow key to flip pages. Or you can use 'j' or 'k' key to flip pages.
